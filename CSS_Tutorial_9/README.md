The tutorial this subdirectory is based on can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-select-html-elements-using-id-class-and-attribute-selectors-in-css).

Introduces id, class and attribute selectors for selecting elements with css. ID is very specific but cannot be reused; it also can be used in hyperlinks by appending #[id value] to the end of a directory, which will take the user to that element on a page. Attribute selectors use brackets (eg [href] for the href attribute in a tags) and can be combined with other forms of selection for very flexible selection. 

Additionally, the ^= operator in CSS indicates that something that begins with the following string will be selected.
