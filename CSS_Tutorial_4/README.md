## CSS_Tutorial_4
The tutorial this subdirectory is based on can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-the-box-model-in-css)

The two new things I learned from this tutorial were that
- Margin between different elements overlap
- `box-sizing: border-box` changes padding & borders such that the two subtract from the overall width instead of adding to it; this makes it really easy to get exact measurements.

...both of these are really cool and I wish I'd known about them sooner.
