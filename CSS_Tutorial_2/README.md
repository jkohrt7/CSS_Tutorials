The tutorial this subdirectory is based on can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-select-html-elements-to-style-with-css)

There are many ways to select html elements for styling; you can
- Use #[id name] to select by id (very specific)
- Use .[class name] to select by class (slightly less specific)
- Combine selectors for more specific selections; just separate them with a space. (more specific than their individual selectors)

You can also select multiple elements/classes/ids by seperating their identifiers with a comma.
