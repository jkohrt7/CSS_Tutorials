                <p>Coral reefs are teeming with life. They are known as the <em>rainforests of the sea</em> with how many various species live within their waters. The defining feature of these ecosystems are the plant-like coral, which are really colonies of tiny invertabrates called <strong>polyps</strong>.</p>
