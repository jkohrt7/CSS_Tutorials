The tutorial this subdirectory is based on can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-apply-css-styles-to-html-with-cascade-and-specificity)

I was pretty comfortable with the topics in this tutorial, but there were some nuggets of wisdom. I learned that you should include italics when importing font styles from google fonts or the browser will attempt to create its own 'faux italics'. `font-style: normal` will remove italics and can be used to remove these faux fonts.
