## CSS_Tutorial_1
The tutorial this subdirectory is based on can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-apply-css-styles-to-html-with-cascade-and-specificity)

The "cascade" in CSS refers to the way CSS rules also apply to their children. To overwrite any general cascading styles, you must make use of selectors that are more specific to a particular element; for example, a style applied to the `body` tag is less specific than one applied to an `article` tag within the body. The specificity algorithm is [actually rather involved](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity), so its something I'll have to read about more in the future.

I also learned that there are over 500 species of sharks :)
